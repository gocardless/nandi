Description:
    Generates two new database migrations which will safely add a foreign key
    constraint and validate it separately.

Example:
    rails generate nandi:foreign_key foos bars

    This will create:
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123727_add_reference_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123728_add_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123729_validate_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb

    These migrations will create a new column on the table foos called bar_id, a
    new foreign key constraint on that column against the id column of bars, and
    validate that constraint separately.

Example:
    rails generate nandi:foreign_key foos bars --type text

    This will create:
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123727_add_reference_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123728_add_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123729_validate_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb

    These migrations will create a new text column on the table foos called bar_id,
    a new foreign key constraint on that column against the id column of bars, and
    validate that constraint separately.

Example:
    rails generate nandi:foreign_key foos bars --no-create-column

    This will create:
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123727_add_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123728_validate_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb

    Assumes that there is a column on table foos called bar_id that points to bars.
    Will create an FK constraint called foos_bars_fk.

Example:
    rails generate nandi:foreign_key foos bars --column special_bar_id --name my_fk

    This will create:
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123727_add_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb
        db/safe_migrations/20190424123728_validate_foreign_key_on_bars_to_foos.rb

    Assumes that there is a column on table foos called special_bar_id that points to
    bars. Will create an FK constraint called my_fk
